- Task Creation and Management: Enable users to create tasks within projects, edit task details (name, description, deadline, priority), mark tasks as complete, and delete tasks.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light blue (#A7D1F5) to create a calm and focused environment, reflecting clarity and productivity.
- Background color: Off-white (#F4F5F7), a slightly desaturated tone of the primary, to maintain visual comfort and readability.
- Accent color: Violet (#D0B6F5) for interactive elements and highlights, adding a touch of creativity and focus.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' sans-serif, for headings and short, impactful text.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' sans-serif for body text, suitable for longer text passages. Paired with Poppins, this provides a balanced, readable interface.
- Use simple and clear icons from Google Material Icons or Lucide Icons to represent different actions and categories.
- Design a minimalist layout, drawing inspiration from Notion, Todoist, and Trello. The focus should be on simplicity and ease of use.
